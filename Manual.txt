Setup:

If you're reading this file, you've done all the setup
required. Just run the .exe from the folder you extracted
the zip into, if you move the .exe from the same
directory as the .dll files and such, then the game
will not run.

1-0 keys: press corresponding finger,

key you want to hit.

How to Play:

You start the game in a house where you must
find Abraham Lincoln. There will be a phrase at the
top of the screen, which you have to type on the
onscreen keyboard, using the onscreen hands.
once you have typed the phrase, hit enter, and if you
typed it correctly, you can move, otherwise your text
will be cleared. To move, just type the number
of the direction that you want to go on the onscreen
keyboard. Keep moving around the house until you
reach Abe.
Once you collide with him, you will be transported to
a boss level, in which you must type an entire document
faster than the progress bar at the top of the screen
fills up. Just keep typing the top line of the document,
then hit enter to go to the next line. When either the
progress bar fills up, or you complete your typing,
